# Git safe push configuration for discovery-node

# This file helps prevent accidental pushes to commercemesh/discovery-node
# Your default remote is: origin (overwayai/discovery-node)

# Safe push commands:
#   git push origin main     ✓ Push to overwayai
#   git push-safe main       ✓ Use alias to push to overwayai
#   git push upstream main   ✗ Blocked by pre-push hook

# To sync with commercemesh (pull only):
#   git fetch upstream
#   git merge upstream/main

# REMEMBER: Always push to origin (overwayai), not upstream (commercemesh)
